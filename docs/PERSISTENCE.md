# Persistence

This describes the persistence layer as implemented. Where a guarantee does not yet hold, it says so under **Open items**.

## Stores and roles

| Store | Role | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL 16 (`DATABASE_URL`) | System of record: `trade_events` ledger, `runs`, `leases`, `schema_migrations`, and in paper mode the `paper_*` venue tables | Yes. Owns the trading lease and fences every write. |
| JSONL journal (`events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`, IST day) | Write-ahead log on local disk; restore source when the ledger is unavailable | Local durability. Source for backfill. |
| Redis 7 (`REDIS_URL`) | Account-wide rate gate and contract cache | No. Losing Redis slows the agent or costs a re-fetch. It never decides a trade. |
| In-process memory | Unit tests only (`PaperExecutionPort`). Production paper mode does not use it. | No. |

PostgreSQL is the only trading authority. A Redis lock can be granted twice across a failover, so it is not used for that decision.

## Keys and identity

- Every run has a UUID `run_id`, created at session start.
- Every event carries `run` (UUID), `seq` (monotonic within the run), `mode`, and `client`.
- Ledger `source_key` is `runId:seq` for events from this build, and `legacy:<day>:<line>` for older journal lines. The column is `UNIQUE`, so re-inserting is idempotent.
- Redis keys are namespaced `dhan-agent:<clientId>:cache:` and `dhan-agent:<clientId>:rl:`. Two client ids never share keys.

## Schema (migrations)

Migrations are in `src/persistence/migrations.ts`, applied in order, each in its own transaction, under advisory lock `727001`.

- `001_ledger`: `trade_events` (`id bigserial`, `source_key` unique, `run_id`, `seq`, `trading_day`, `ts`, `event_type`, `underlying`, `correlation_id`, `record jsonb`).
- `002_lease_and_tags`: `leases (client_id PK, holder_run, epoch, expires_at)`, and the mode/client tags used by restore.
- `003_append_only_and_run_safety`: a trigger on `trade_events` raises on `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE`. `runs` gains `unconfirmed_at_end` and `acknowledged`.

`004_paper_venue`: `paper_wallets` (balance cannot go negative), `paper_positions` (a position closes once; a trigger refuses any change to a closed one), `paper_orders` and `paper_wallet_entries` (append-only, same as `trade_events`). Every cash movement records the balance it leaves.

`005_paper_withdrawals`: `paper_withdrawals` (append-only, one row per week or month). A withdrawal debits the wallet with a cash entry `WITHDRAWAL:<period>`, so wallet entries no longer all reference an order. Exits credit proceeds less estimated round-trip charges. `npm run withdraw` takes a share of the last completed period's net P&L; `npm run reconcile` checks `initial + realised P&L − open premium − withdrawn = balance`. The agent sizes off the day's opening capital (wallet cash + open premium − today's realised), so profit compounds and withdrawals reduce it.

The migrator refuses to run when an applied migration's checksum (sha256) has changed, or when the database holds a version this build does not know.

## Modes and accounts

The three modes are `live`, `sandbox` and `paper` (`src/domain/mode.ts`). Market data is always the live Dhan feed. Only the order venue differs.

| Mode | Order venue | Lease account key | Required stores |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| live | Dhan production (`dhan` credentials) | `live:<clientId>` | PostgreSQL, Redis |
| sandbox | Dhan sandbox via the SDK's `hybrid` mode (`DHAN_SANDBOX_*`) | `sandbox:<clientId>` | PostgreSQL, Redis |
| paper, `PAPER_BACKEND=postgres` | PostgreSQL paper venue | `paper:<clientId>` | PostgreSQL (Redis optional) |
| paper, `PAPER_BACKEND=exchange` | paper_exchange server (`PAPER_EXCHANGE_*`) | `paper:<clientId>` | PostgreSQL (Redis optional) |

Sandbox uses one SDK client in `hybrid` mode (`@nemesis-oss/dhanhq-sdk` v1.3.0). Market data, option chain, charts and the market feed go to production on the production credentials. Orders, positions, funds and controls go to `sandbox.dhan.co` on the sandbox credentials. The SDK refuses a trading call the sandbox does not serve, and never falls back to production.

Each mode has its own lease and its own review queue, so a paper run never blocks a live run for the same client. Journal and ledger rows are tagged with the mode, so restore never replays one mode's events into another.

## Paper venue

`PostgresPaperExecutionPort` simulates fills with the same rules as the in-memory venue: entry at the reference premium plus slippage, rounded up to tick; stop and target enforced on option LTP; a gap through the stop fills at the LTP. Every state change is one fenced transaction in `PostgresPaperStore`. The database write happens before its event is emitted:

- Entry: debits the wallet and records the position and entry order. Insufficient cash is `ENTRY_REJECTED`. A failed write is `ENTRY_UNCONFIRMED`, which halts the agent.
- Exit or protective exit: closes the position, credits the wallet and records the realised P&L (credit minus debit, to the paisa). A failed agent exit is `EXIT_UNCONFIRMED` and the position stays open. A failed protective exit is `BROKER_MISMATCH`, which halts the agent.
- Wallet: created once with `CAPITAL_INR`. A later start with a different capital is refused, not silently ignored.
- Restart: the venue reloads the wallet and open positions. The orchestrator refuses to start while the venue holds an open position, the same rule live applies to open broker legs.

### Gateway venues (sandbox and paper_exchange)

Dhan's sandbox serves no super orders and no WebSocket, and paper_exchange has no exchange-held bracket. Both therefore use `GatewayExecutionPort` (`src/execution/gatewayPort.ts`), which sends market orders through an `OrderGateway` and enforces stops and targets on option LTP itself:

- `DhanSandboxGateway` places a regular INTRADAY MARKET order and polls `orders.getById` until it settles, using the SDK's typed `filledQty` and `averageTradedPrice`. A still-working order is cancelled at the deadline. A fill with no average price is unconfirmed.
- `PaperExchangeGateway` sends a market order with `execution_price` set to the agent's premium and `reduce_only` on sells. The server fills it inside the POST. The fill price is read from the order's TRADE ledger entry, because the order response has none. An order not filled at once is cancelled.

Every order id sent to a venue is at most 30 characters (`src/execution/brokerIds.ts`). That is the limit in Dhan's own OpenAPI for `OrderRequest` and `SuperOrderRequest`. Ids are one letter, the time in base36, and a counter. The port refuses any longer id before it sends anything. Before this limit was enforced, agent exit ids were about 33 characters, so live and sandbox exits would have been refused.

Fills differ by venue. paper_exchange fills are net of its charges: a buy is premium plus charges, and a sell is premium less charges. The agent's P&L then matches the server's wallet. Dhan fills are gross, as the venue reports them, so the day book does not deduct brokerage or taxes on live or sandbox trades. That is recorded under Open items.

On startup the paper_exchange account must be INR. The agent refuses to start otherwise, because Indian option premiums are rupee amounts. A 401 or 403 from paper_exchange is UNCONFIRMED, so a wrong key halts the agent rather than rejecting every entry.

The agent's own stop is the difference from live. If the process dies with a position open on these venues, nothing stops it out until the next start. Live does not have this gap, because its legs are held by the exchange.

## Trading lease and fencing

- `PostgresLeaseStore` runs every statement on the database clock. A new holder can take the lease only after `expires_at` plus `ORDER_TIMEOUT_MS`, so an order in flight from the old holder can finish.
- `epoch` increments on every acquisition. A renewal succeeds only for the same `(run, epoch)` while unexpired.
- `Lease` renews every `ttl/3` on its own single-connection pool. It counts a renewal as successful only when the request was sent less than `ttl` ago, measured on a monotonic clock. `holds()` is false once that window passes.
- Every write through the ledger or the paper store goes through `runFenced`: a transaction that takes `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` on the lease row for its `(account, run, epoch)`. A takeover cannot commit mid-write. A fenced-out writer gets `LeaseLostError` and its rows are not written.
- The trading gate refuses **entries** when the lease is not held. Exits are not gated by the lease (see Failure semantics).

## Journal (JSONL)

- One file per IST trading day. Lines are written with `fdatasync` for durable events.
- A failed partial write is truncated back to the last complete line.
- A torn final line from a crash is either completed (if it parses) or moved to a quarantine file. `repairTornTail` runs before every backfill.
- The journal is append-only. Backfill never rewrites it.

## Write path and the entry gate

`EventLog.durable(event)`:
1. Appends and `fdatasync`s the journal line.
2. Awaits the ledger insert.
3. If the ledger insert fails, enqueues the event in the outbox (bounded at 10 000, batched at 500, exponential backoff) and rejects.

`EventLog.unconfirmedEvents()` counts outbox items. While it is non-zero, entries are refused.

Before a live entry:
1. Persist `entry_submitted` durably, under a 2 s deadline (`INTENT_DEADLINE_MS`). Failure means `INTENT_NOT_DURABLE`, and no order is sent.
2. Recheck the gate. A failure records `entry_rejected` with `ABORTED_AFTER_INTENT`.
3. Dispatch the order. There is no `await` between the gate recheck and the broker call.

## Failure semantics

| Failure | Entries | Exits |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL unreachable at start | Refuse to start (`persistence startup failed`) | n/a |
| Ledger insert failing at runtime | Refused while events are unconfirmed | Proceed; `exit_submitted` is recorded as `audit_gap` if its intent write failed |
| Lease not held | Refused | Proceed |
| Paper venue write fails | Halted (`ENTRY_UNCONFIRMED`) | Agent exit halted (`EXIT_UNCONFIRMED`); protective exit halted (`BROKER_MISMATCH`) |
| Redis unreachable | Rate gate and cache fall back or miss; no trading effect | Same |
| Unconfirmed events at shutdown | Recorded on `runs.unconfirmed_at_end`; the next live start refuses until acknowledged | n/a |

Exits proceed on lease loss because an open position with no working exit is the larger risk. `submitExit` reads the broker position before it sends anything: if the position cannot be read, it sends nothing and records `EXIT_UNCONFIRMED`. It never sells more than the broker shows.

## Startup (`openSession`)

1. Migrate. Refuse on checksum mismatch or an unknown version.
2. Create the lease pool (single connection, statement timeout below the renewal interval) and the ledger pool.
3. Connect Redis (`PING`). Failure is redacted and fatal in live mode.
4. Register the run in `runs`.
5. Acquire the account's lease. Then refuse while `runsNeedingReview` is non-empty for that mode and client. That covers earlier runs of the same mode that never ended, or that ended with unconfirmed events, and are not acknowledged.
6. Restore the day (below). Refusals name the exact remedy.

Any startup failure closes what was opened and throws a redacted error. No credential reaches a log line.

## Restore

`restoreFromLedger` runs `backfillDay` for today, then:
- Refuses if the day has untagged rows (`untaggedDayCount > 0`). Those predate mode and client tags, so they cannot be attributed.
- Reads `dayLines(day, {mode, clientId})`, ordered by run start, then `seq`.
- Replays through `restoreDayBook`. Operator events are replayed. Unresolved intents receive a zero-P&L close with a cooldown.

`backfillDay`:
- Parses every line. Refuses on malformed JSON, a bad timestamp, a line from another IST day, a partial `run`/`seq`, a non-UUID run id, or a gap in a run's sequence.
- Verifies afterwards that every key in the file is present in the ledger. Otherwise it throws, rather than restoring a set it cannot prove complete.

Without a `DATABASE_URL`, restore reads the journal directly through `scopeJournalLines`, which applies the same mode and client filter.

## Acknowledging a run

`npm run db:acknowledge -- --run <runId> --reason "<what you checked>"` requires a UUID and a reason of at least 10 characters. It sets `acknowledged`, closes a never-ended run with `acknowledged: <reason>`, and records the reason. Check the broker's positions and orders before acknowledging.

## Operations

- Migrate: `npm run db:migrate`. Status: `npm run db:status`.
- Local services: `docker compose up -d` (PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7 on `127.0.0.1`; Redis runs with `appendonly yes` and `noeviction`).
- Tests: `npm test` runs every suite. The integration tests in `tests/persistence.integration.test.ts` run only when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and `TEST_REDIS_URL` are set, and are skipped otherwise. `npm run test:integration` runs that file alone. With `CI=true` and either URL unset, the module throws instead of skipping.

## Open items

These are known gaps. Each one is a stated requirement, not a shipped guarantee.

0. **paper_exchange has no server-side protections for options.** The server's protections key on the position's underlying symbol (`PositionProtection#instrument_id` is `position.symbol`), and the monitor reads the mark price by that symbol. An option stop would be compared with the index price. This agent therefore keeps stops on its own side for paper_exchange. The fix belongs in paper_exchange: key protection quotes by the option contract.
0a. **Restart with open paper or sandbox positions.** The agent cannot yet re-adopt an open position into its state machine. Restart with an open paper position is refused until it is closed. Adoption needs an `UnderlyingAgent` restore path, which does not exist for live either.
0b. **Sandbox stops are agent-side.** Sandbox fills are polled, not streamed, and stops are sent by the agent (see Gateway venues). A process that dies with a sandbox position open leaves it without a stop.
0c. **Sandbox base URL.** `DHAN_SANDBOX_BASE_URL` is optional and defaults to the SDK's `sandbox.dhan.co`. When set, it must be https and not `api.dhan.co` or the market-data host.
0d. **paper_exchange upstream issues** (found by running the server, not by reading it):
   - `POST /api/account/reset` hard-codes `currency: "USD"`. Indian paper accounts therefore cannot trade until someone sets the currency to INR by hand. The reset should take a currency.
   - `positions_count` and `GET /api/positions` include closed positions with zero quantity. The agent counts only non-zero rows.
   - A repeated `client_order_id` returns the existing order, including a rejected one. Retries are safe, but a rejection stays sticky until a new id is used.
0e. **P&L basis differs by venue.** paper_exchange fills include charges. Dhan fills do not, so live and sandbox day-book P&L is gross of brokerage and taxes.

1. **Synchronous replication.** Live mode assumes PostgreSQL `synchronous_commit = on` with a synchronous standby. Nothing checks this at startup. Until it is enforced, a failover can lose the last committed events, and restore cannot see them.
2. **TLS.** `validatePostgresUrl` checks scheme and host only. Live use should require `sslmode=verify-full` and `sslrootcert`, and Redis should use `rediss://`. Not enforced yet.
3. **Two database roles.** The migrator should be a separate role run as a separate command. The application role should hold only `SELECT` and `INSERT` on `trade_events`. Not yet split.
4. **Halt and breach latches across days.** Per-underlying halts and the operator block are restored from today's events only. A latch from a prior day is not carried forward. Operator clear is not yet refused while a halt or breach is latched.
5. **Broker kill switch journalling.** `broker_kill_engaged` and `broker_kill_failed` are not journalled yet. On start, the agent does not re-engage the kill switch when a breach is latched without a confirmed engage.
6. **Broker reconciliation.** Realised P&L is not reconciled against the broker at start. `PositionResponse.realizedProfit` and `orders.listTrades` semantics are not verified against the SDK, so this is not implemented as a hard refusal.
7. **Backfill window.** Only today's journal is backfilled. Retained days are not checked in both directions for key-set equality.
8. **Retention and recovery.** Backup, point-in-time recovery, the RPO target, a restore drill, and the journal-to-ledger rebuild procedure are operator decisions. They are not documented with numbers here. Retention for journal files and `trade_events` is not yet defined.
9. **Pre-existing halt behaviour.** A halt engages the broker kill switch immediately, even with positions open. That conflicts with the rule that exits must not be blocked. It is outside this change and is tracked separately.

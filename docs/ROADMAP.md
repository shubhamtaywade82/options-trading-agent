# Roadmap

Where this agent goes next, in order, with the gate each step must pass. Revised 2026-11-03 against `main` at
`32874ca`; status checked 2026-11-08 against `main` at `368748f`. The branch `ccr-e5f824c3-nhd407` (seven further commits,
listed under Phase 1) is not in this repository. Its hashes are mapped to `main` after the PR plan. It extends what
exists; it is not a rewrite.

## Where the repository actually stands

Read this before any plan. Four facts set the order of everything below.

1. **No strategy has shown a net edge, and the untouched holdout is spent.** Time Machine on NIFTY, BANKNIFTY and SENSEX
   (2025H2–2026H1, about 550 priced trades each) returns mean net R between −0.004 and +0.046. The one
   `EDGE_SUPPORTED` verdict (NIFTY 2025H) used a 0.25% half-spread; at 1% the same family is `NO_TRADE`. The first
   context-cell holdout (NIFTY 2026H) passed nothing. But 2026H had already been used: exit variants (stop %, R target,
   time stop, IV-crush exit) were tested on NIFTY 2025-10..2026-09, which contains NIFTY 2026H, and on SENSEX and
   BANKNIFTY 2026-04..09 (`TIME_MACHINE.md`). No period in the repository's data is untouched any more. The next confirmatory test needs data collected after its
   pre-registration (OTA-314).
2. **Strategy attribution depends on catalogue order.** `StrategySession.evaluate` returns the first enabled strategy
   that signals on a bar. Live and replay both use it, so a bar that would fire both range and momentum is credited to
   range only. Per-strategy results are biased by the order of `STRATEGY_CATALOG`.
3. **The statistics are weaker than the verdict wording suggests.** Both the Time Machine verdict and the context-cell
   verdict take the confidence interval over the whole sample. The out-of-sample check only requires a positive mean.
   The Time Machine's default minimum out-of-sample trade count is 10, against the 30 the paper gate requires. The
   multiple-testing divisor counts only logged runs on the same `dataSha256`, so any change to a dataset resets it to zero.
4. **Risk and research disagree on cost.** Sizing and the pre-trade daily-loss check use planned stop-distance risk only.
   The replay also charges half-spread stop slippage (`stopSlippagePct` = half-spread) and round-trip charges.

Two further facts. Live execution has defects closed in code but no sandbox record, so broker behaviour is still assumed
(`docs/BROKER_CONTRACT.md`). The SDK in use is `@nemesis-oss/dhanhq-sdk` 2.0.1 (the lockfile and `package.json` range),
while the README and Time Machine docs still describe 1.3.0.

So the order is: keep the live path safe, make the research statistics honest, and only then search for an edge. An AI
research layer on top of a strategy set with no edge only searches noise faster.

## Approvals and principles (recorded 2026-11-03)

Approved: the docs-only roadmap; the exact SDK pin at `2.0.1`; the holdout rules as eligibility floors, not as a statistical
success criterion; OTA-311 paper first, with live enforcement waiting for sign-off; and the priority order below. Further
approved the same day: both holdout proposals, the best-session test and the five-session block floor, with a profit-share cap on one
session's share of profit added alongside them; and the look-ahead-free expiry. Not approved: any live use of all-in
enforcement, and any change to the live risk calculation outside its policy.

Priority order: OTA-106 (sandbox lifecycle record), then the research ledger and pre-registration, then OTA-307 (independent
replay), OTA-308 (holdout validation), OTA-309 (market-context attribution), OTA-310 (previous-day completeness), OTA-311
(all-in risk, paper first), and then OTA-312 onward (SDK, documentation and remaining verification).

Three systems, kept apart:

```text
RESEARCH PLANE                       TRADING PLANE
Generate hypotheses                  Strategy evaluation
Deterministic replay                 Context gating
Statistical validation               Risk management
Human approval  ───────────────►     Option selection
                                     Order execution
```

The research plane can propose strategies and parameters. It never changes live trading configuration or risk limits by itself,
and a promotion needs a human decision. The trading plane is deterministic and does not depend on the language model being
available. A `Spent` window can still describe the market, but it cannot confirm anything.

## Standing rules

- **Do not tune SuperTrend, EMA, or stop/target parameters** until a pre-registered hypothesis needs them.
- **Any period used to choose, tune or diagnose a result is spent for that question.** `docs/research/HOLDOUT.md`
  (OTA-308) records every use. A spent period can still be used for description, not for confirmation.
- **No promotion without a pre-registration** (`docs/research/PREREG.md`, OTA-308) committed before the run it tests.
- **Live strategy selection stays first-match** until OTA-307 has produced an isolated per-strategy result and a
  replacement is proven by the same gates.
- **The research plane never writes live config.** Unchanged from `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-001.

### External review findings, checked against the code

| Finding | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bracket-leg cancel treated as confirmed on request accept | Fixed in code (OTA-101) | `awaitLegsTerminal` polls the super order book for a terminal leg status; `legDetails` shape still unverified against sandbox |
| Unconfirmed entry dropped after 10 min | Fixed in code (OTA-102) | Dropped only when the super order book shows it settled or absent; restart refuses to start with a live broker order or unadoptable position |
| Broker kill switch: no retry or confirmation | Fixed in code (OTA-103) | Activation reads the switch back; a failure retries every 30 s and journals `broker_kill_switch_failed` (an alert) once per failure streak |
| Feed freshness from receipt time only | Fixed in code (OTA-104) | `DhanFeed.ageMs` runs from min(receipt, exchange LTT); a lagging LTT is logged once (feed delay or fast host clock) |
| 25/60-min bars accepted with a 15-min ORB | Fixed in code (OTA-105) | Config requires `ORB_MINUTES` to be a whole number of `BAR_MINUTES`; `sessionRange` returns no range unless every opening-range bar is present |
| Late fill while HALTED left unmanaged | Fixed | `canExit` allows `HALTED && !exitSent` (`underlyingAgent.ts`) |
| Daily P&L gross of costs | Fixed | `closedPnl` books net of `roundTripChargesInr` |
| Sizing on reference price under a MARKET fill | Fixed | Entry is a LIMIT at ask × (1 + buffer) and sizing uses that limit (`entryPlan.ts`) |
| Super Order without `price` | Fixed in code | `price: order.entryReference`; wire format still unverified against sandbox |
| Restart books an unresolved entry at zero P&L | Fixed on branch (OTA-107) | Booked at planned stop loss plus charges (`ops/dayState.ts`) |
| Ambiguous exit SELL could be resent | Fixed on branch (OTA-108) | `exitOutcomeUnknown` blocks a second SELL until a definitive outcome (`dhan/liveExecution.ts`) |

## The plan

Six phases, unchanged. The phase 3 gate is tighter than before, because the research must now survive a holdout that
has not been used.

| # | Phase | Gate to leave it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Execution safety | Every lifecycle scenario has a failing-then-passing test; sandbox run of entry → cancel → exit recorded in `docs/` (OTA-106) |
| 2 | Data integrity | Each research dataset has a quality report, a checksum and an SDK version; replay is reproducible; the multiple-testing ledger counts every variant |
| 3 | Edge discovery | A pre-registered strategy × context cell passes the holdout gate (OTA-308): holdout-only confidence interval above zero, minimum sample and days, positive at 1% half-spread and at 2× stop slippage |
| 4 | Paper validation | ≥ 30 paper trades of that cell, live-observed slippage within the TM cost model |
| 5 | Supervised live | All-in risk budget (OTA-311) in force; strict caps, operator present, rollback tested |
| 6 | Research automation (AI) | Only after phase 3 has passed once by hand, on a pre-registered hypothesis |

Phases 1 and 2 run in parallel. Track A (research correctness, OTA-307 to OTA-313) needs no broker credentials. Track B
(OTA-106 and OTA-314) needs them and is run by the operator. 3 needs Track A and OTA-314. 4 needs 1 and 3. 6 needs 3.

---

### Phase 1 — Execution safety

Each item: reproduce with a failing test against the fake Dhan client, fix, rerun `npm run check`.

| ID | Work | Where | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OTA-101 | Confirm bracket-leg cancellation by reading leg status (super order book) after `cancel`, polling until `CANCELLED`/`TRADED`; if a leg shows `TRADED`, skip the manual SELL and report the protective exit; on timeout, HALT and alert | `liveExecution.ts` `cancelBracketLegs`, `cancelBracketLegsWithRetry` | Tests: cancel accepted but leg still pending; stop fills during manual exit (no SELL sent); poll timeout halts |
| OTA-102 | Never drop an unconfirmed entry on age alone. Resolve against order book + positions until terminal | `liveExecution.ts` reconcile loop | Tests: fill appears at minute 15 and is adopted; restart with an unresolved entry is refused while the broker holds it |
| OTA-103 | Broker kill switch: retry on failure; read the switch back after success; alert on failure | `orchestrator.ts`, `liveExecution.ts` `engageBrokerKillSwitch` | Tests: first call rejects, second succeeds; status read-back mismatch alerts |
| OTA-104 | Freshness on exchange time, not only receipt time | `dhan/feed.ts`, `underlyingAgent.ts` | Test: steady packets with an old `ltt` mark the feed stale |
| OTA-105 | Reject `ORB_MINUTES` not a multiple of `BAR_MINUTES`; refuse a range signal when any opening-range bar is missing | `config.ts`, `strategy/orbSupertrend.ts` | Tests: `BAR_MINUTES=25, ORB_MINUTES=15` throws; gap in ORB bars yields no signal |
| OTA-106 | **(a) Done (`7596b9b`):** redacted wire recorder in `src/dhan/wireRecorder.ts`, wired into `scripts/smoke-trade-cycle.ts`. **(b) Open, blocked on Dhan sandbox credentials:** the operator runs `smoke:trade`, and the recording lands in `docs/sandbox/`. | `scripts/smoke-trade-cycle.ts`, `src/dhan/wireRecorder.ts` | Recording checked in; every "Assumed" row in `docs/BROKER_CONTRACT.md` moves to "Recorded" or becomes a failing test |
| OTA-107 | **Done (`07d0778`).** Restart books an unresolved entry at its all-in adverse loss, never zero; a superseded unresolved entry is booked too; an unusable stop or tick refuses startup | `ops/dayState.ts`, `runtime/underlyingAgent.ts` (journals `exchangeSegment` and `tickSize`) | `tests/dayState.test.ts` |
| OTA-108 | **Done (`70c7f57`).** An exit SELL whose outcome is unknown blocks any further SELL until a definitive rejection, a no-fill terminal status, or a flat broker position | `dhan/liveExecution.ts` | `tests/liveExecution.test.ts` "ambiguous exits (failure injection)" |
| OTA-109 | **Done (`809e7d9`; the behaviour predates it).** Restart refuses while the broker holds a live order with no position yet | `runtime/createRuntime.ts`, `orchestrator.ts` | `tests/runtime.test.ts` |

Out of scope here: a new order-manager or recovery module. The fixes live in the adapter that already owns them.

### Phase 2 — Data integrity

| ID | Work | Where | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OTA-201 | **Done.** `dataQuality` in every report and `runs.jsonl` line | `research/timeMachine.ts` | Fixture test |
| OTA-202 | **Done.** SHA-256 of the dataset file in every `runs.jsonl` line (`dataSha256`) | `scripts/timemachine.ts` | Same file and config give identical lines except `ts` |
| OTA-203 | **Done for NIFTY (Tue) and SENSEX (Thu), revised (`3cf66f4`).** Each session takes its nominal expiry, the next expiry weekday on or after its date. The earlier holiday shift read later sessions and was removed. BANKNIFTY monthly still has no rule | `time/calendar.ts` (`nominalWeeklyExpiry`), `research/replay.ts` (`rollingWeeklyExpiry`) | `tests/timeMachine.test.ts` |
| OTA-204 | **Revised: fresh holdout data, see OTA-314.** Chain snapshots start 2026-10-27; every stored dataset ends 2026-09-30 | — | — |
| OTA-205 | **Done.** `run --cells --vix <file>` tags days by opening-VIX tercile | `research/contextCells.ts` | In cell report |

Not now: a feature registry service, Greeks engine, event-calendar feed, PostgreSQL research tables. Datasets are JSON
files with a manifest line in `runs.jsonl`; that is enough until a query needs more.

### Phase 3 — Edge discovery (context-conditioned)

Each strategy family (range, trend, ema_cross, momentum, continuation, prev_day) is judged alone, per context cell, on
the same data and costs. The live gate and selector stay as they are until a result earns a change.

| ID | Work | Where | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OTA-301 | **Done.** Each replayed trade carries `context` (regime, trend alignment, time bucket, expiry day) | `research/replay.ts` | Test |
| OTA-302 | **Done.** `run --cells` per-cell n, mean R, bootstrap CI, P(≤0), out-of-sample R, PF, verdict | `research/contextCells.ts` | Tests |
| OTA-303 | **Superseded by OTA-313.** Bonferroni divisor counted only runs on the same `dataSha256`, which resets on any dataset change | `research/contextCells.ts` | — |
| OTA-304 | **Done, first pass, burned.** Best two 2025H cells failed on 2026H. 2026H is no longer a holdout (Fact 1) | `docs/TIME_MACHINE.md` | Logged in `HOLDOUT.md` (OTA-308) |
| OTA-305 | If a cell passes the OTA-308 gate: gate live entry on that cell (a context allow-list in config), nothing else | `runtime/tradingGate.ts` / entry plan | Paper agent only trades in passed cells |
| OTA-307 | **Done (`f0f98b5`).** **Independent strategy evaluation.** Research replays each family alone (`--strategy <id>`), and `--shadow` reports what first-match credited and hid. Live `evaluate()` is unchanged | `scripts/timemachine.ts`, `strategy/session.ts` (`candidates()`), `research/replay.ts` (`EntryObserver`), `research/shadow.ts` | `tests/isolation.test.ts` |
| OTA-309 | **Done (`1a157e2`), with one open item.** **Context features, research only.** Trade context now carries `volatility` (ATR tercile of its own history), `structureAlignment`, `expiryBucket`, and `chainBias`, recorded as `UNKNOWN`. **Look-ahead fixed (`3cf66f4`):** expiry is nominal and depends on the session's own date. **Residual:** an exchange holiday on the expiry weekday is not modelled, so the session before it is NEAR, not EXPIRY. **Not tested end to end:** the no-lookahead property holds by construction, because the history passed to the features ends at the signal bar, and the feature functions are tested alone | `research/tradeFeatures.ts`, `research/replay.ts` (`tradeContext`), `research/contextCells.ts` | `tests/tradeFeatures.test.ts` |
| OTA-310 | **Done (`1e6f417`).** **Previous-day breakout completeness.** The level comes only from a complete session on the bar grid, no more than four calendar days back. The ORB range uses the same bar-count helper. Stays research-only | `strategy/levelBreak.ts`, `time/sessionCoverage.ts`, `strategy/orbSupertrend.ts` | `tests/previousDay.test.ts` |

Not now: a strategy registry with lifecycle states, a weighted scoring formula, a ranking engine. Build ranking when two
pre-registered cells compete for the same bar.

New strategy families (VWAP reversion, squeeze breakout, failed-breakout reversal) are added one at a time as functions in
`strategy/session.ts`, each pre-registered and judged by the same per-cell report. Do not add a family before OTA-307 and
OTA-308 exist, because its result would be attributed through the first-match order.

### Phase 3 research hardening (OTA-308 to OTA-313)

| ID | Work | Where | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OTA-308 | **Done (`9b3855e` a–b, `a07afd8` c–e, `512b7d4` floors, `3cf66f4` profit-share cap, derived in `docs/research/DOMINANCE.md`).** **Holdout discipline, as eligibility floors.** The holdout needs at least 30 out-of-sample trades and at least 30 independent sessions. The result must survive removing its single most profitable session. The holdout bootstrap blocks at least five sessions, so dependence within a trading week survives. Cost stress at 1% half-spread and 2× stop slippage can only downgrade. These floors are not statistical significance: the interval and the pre-registered hypothesis decide. Both the best-session test and a 25% cap on one session's share of positive net R must pass. Runs are labelled `holdout-v3` | `research/timeMachine.ts`, `research/contextCells.ts`, `research/stats.ts`, `docs/research/` | `tests/timeMachine.test.ts` (including a mutation check that bootstrapping the whole sample fails) |
| OTA-313 | **Done (`c0bde8f`), superseded in its counting by OTA-315.** The divisor counts every variant, not only same-hash runs. Seeded floors are preserved as ledger backfills (see OTA-315) | `research/ledger.ts` (removed), `docs/research/experiments.jsonl` | `tests/committedLedger.test.ts` |
| OTA-315 | **Done (`059d5c9`). Immutable research ledger.** `docs/research/experiments.jsonl` is append-only and hash-chained. Each variant is one record with its hypothesis, strategy, parameter fingerprint, dataset hash, date range, overlap group, experiment type, holdout status, cost fingerprint, provenance, result and time. Editing, removing or reordering one fails verification. A new dataset hash is a new record in the same overlap group, not a reset. A confirmation needs a registration first and a Frozen window. The 2026H confirmation is kept as a Spent backfill, never relabelled. `scripts/ledger.ts` provides `verify`, `backfill-docs`, `import` and `register` | `research/experimentLedger.ts`, `research/ledgerStore.ts`, `research/documentedEvidence.ts`, `scripts/ledger.ts` | `tests/experimentLedger.test.ts`, `tests/committedLedger.test.ts` |
| OTA-316 | **Done (`a18a18c`).** Every fetched dataset records the installed SDK version (read from the package actually loaded), the parser version, and the response layout version. The schema declares the block, so it survives a reload. Datasets fetched before this record UNKNOWN provenance, and nothing infers it | `research/dataset.ts`, `scripts/timemachine.ts` | `tests/timeMachine.test.ts` |

Trade-off to decide in review: many cells with a fixed Bonferroni bar make each cell very hard to pass. That is intended.
The honest response is fewer, pre-registered cells, not a looser divisor.

### Phase 4 — Paper validation

| ID | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OTA-401 | `report:performance` split by the same context cells, compared to the TM expectation for that cell | Paper vs replay mean R and slippage shown side by side |
| OTA-402 | Slippage distribution from paper fills vs the TM cost model | If paper slippage exceeds the model, rerun phase 3 with the observed cost |

Gate: ≥ 30 trades in the passed cell; result inside the TM confidence interval.

### Phase 5 — Supervised live

Existing safeguards stay (live caps on risk %, `ENFORCE_DAILY_LOSS=true`, explicit live acknowledgement).

| ID | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OTA-311 | **Done (`2e3c6c8`, `841917a`): a rollout policy, paper in shadow.** `ALL_IN_RISK_POLICY` is `off`, `shadow` or `enforce`. Every entry journals planned and all-in risk and whether the all-in budget would have refused it. `off` and `shadow` decide on planned risk, exactly as before. `enforce` decides on all-in risk, and in live mode it needs `ALL_IN_RISK_LIVE_ACK`. The paper profile is `shadow`. Rollout: (1) calculate both, (2) journal both, (3) compare predicted all-in loss with paper fills (`scripts/risk-shadow.ts`), (4) test charges, slippage and gaps through the stop, (5) validate the daily-loss check under enforcement, (6) request approval for live. Steps 1 and 2 are done. Steps 3 to 6 need paper trades | `risk/allInLoss.ts`, `risk/riskEngine.ts`, `risk/riskShadow.ts`, `runtime/underlyingAgent.ts`, `config.ts`, `config.paper.yml`, `scripts/risk-shadow.ts` | `tests/allInLoss.test.ts`, `tests/riskEngine.test.ts`, `tests/riskShadow.test.ts`, `tests/config.test.ts` |
| OTA-501 | Readiness checklist run (README "Verification required before live") with phase 1 tests and the sandbox record attached | Signed-off checklist in the journal |
| OTA-502 | Restart drills: kill the process with an open position; with Redis down; with PostgreSQL down. Each recovers via broker reconciliation | Drill notes in `docs/PERSISTENCE.md` |
| OTA-503 | Daily contract-note reconciliation of charges vs `roundTripChargesInr` | Difference reported by `npm run reconcile` |
| OTA-504 | Minimum size (1 lot, one underlying) for the first 20 live trades; operator present | Live vs paper slippage compared |

Monitoring already exists (cockpit, ntfy alerts, journal summary). Add an alert for each new halt reason from phase 1; no
metrics stack until something needs a graph the cockpit cannot show.

### Phase 6 — Research automation (AI), only after phase 3 passes by hand

The proposal's eight-agent research plane is the end state, not the next step. The first useful version is small:

1. A script that reads the per-cell report and `runs.jsonl`, asks the local Ollama model for the next hypotheses, and
   writes them as pre-registration entries (not as live config).
2. The deterministic Time Machine runs them; the multiple-testing ledger (OTA-313) charges every one.
3. A candidate becomes a pull request for the operator to read. Promotion is a human merge, not code.

Fixed boundaries, unchanged from today's advisor: the model never places orders, never edits live config or risk limits,
and generated code never runs inside the trading process. Failed hypotheses stay in `runs.jsonl` so they count against k.

### Supporting tickets

| ID | Work | Where | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OTA-312 | **Done (`8a2b56a`).** **Documentation and dependency alignment.** README lines that say `npm ci` installs 1.3.0 (it installs 2.0.1 from the lockfile) and the "exact pin" wording; `docs/TIME_MACHINE.md` and `docs/PERSISTENCE.md` SDK versions; "all five strategies" in `TIME_MACHINE.md` (five active, one research-only); the "ML-based" docstring on `adaptiveSuperTrend`. `package.json` is pinned exactly to `2.0.1`, and the lockfile matches | `README.md`, `docs/*.md`, `package.json`, `src/market/indicators.ts` | `tests/docs.test.ts` |
| OTA-314 | **Open, blocked on credentials.** **Fresh holdout data (operator).** Fetch premium and spot bars from 2026-10-01 to the latest session with `--dump-raw`, check the response layout against SDK 2.0.1, record `sdkVersion` in each dataset manifest, and log the period as untouched in `HOLDOUT.md`. The 2026-10-26 raw response was used for a layout check only, not for any P&L decision | `scripts/timemachine.ts`, `research/dataset.ts`, `docs/research/HOLDOUT.md` | Layout check recorded against 2.0.1; manifests carry `sdkVersion`; holdout window frozen before any pre-registered test runs on it |

**Expectation to state plainly.** The repository's historical data cannot give a clean holdout any more. A fresh window of
about a month holds roughly 46 priced trades per underlying (550 trades over the 12-month 2025H2–2026H1 window, which is
arithmetic from those counts, not a measured rate). Split across 60 cells, most cells would hold one or two trades. A
30-trade confirmation per cell therefore needs months of data, or far fewer pre-registered cells, pooled across
underlyings where the rule is the same. Plan for months. Do not shorten the gate to make the calendar fit.

## PR plan

Each row is one pull request, reviewed on its own. Order respects dependencies. Track B rows need credentials, so the

PRs 1 to 9 and 13 to 16 are on `main`, but not as the separate reviewed pull requests this table describes. They arrived
in squash commit `1b9de9b` (62 files), with the previous-day signal in `32874ca`. See the commit mapping below. PR 8 is on in paper and off in live: live needs operator sign-off. PRs 10 to 12 need Dhan credentials or the frozen window, so they wait for the operator. The earlier note said PRs 1 to 9 need no credentials, which was true when written.
PR 12 is the first run that can produce a confirmatory result. If it fails, the hypothesis is recorded as failed in
`runs.jsonl` and the next pre-registration starts from a new hypothesis, not from a parameter change.

## What is deliberately not on this roadmap

- Option selling, spreads, futures, other brokers.
- A `src/` restructure into new bounded-module folders.
- New PostgreSQL research schema (11 tables), Zod schemas for every domain object, OpenTelemetry, a strategy registry
  service. Each waits for a concrete need.
- Eight independent AI research agents, a strategy-ranking microservice, a Greeks engine before historical option data
  justifies it, and an autonomous promotion engine.
- Automatic promotion, automatic size scaling after profitable runs, LLM edits to live configuration.

## Decision and contract records

- `docs/DECISIONS.md`: architecture decisions, each with the test or review step that enforces it.
- `docs/BROKER_CONTRACT.md`: every broker touchpoint with its evidence level. Nothing is recorded from a sandbox yet, so
  OTA-106 is still the gate for the live path.
- `tests/architecture.test.ts`: enforces that research and strategy code never reach the broker, execution or runtime
  layers, and that only the two venue adapters write to the broker.
- `docs/research/PREREG.md` and `docs/research/HOLDOUT.md`: created by PR 3 (OTA-308).

## Success measures

| Measure | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Silently untracked broker orders or positions | Zero, by test |
| Kill-switch activation failures without an alert | Zero |
| Research runs without dataset hash, config fingerprint and SDK version | Zero |
| Research variants not counted in the multiple-testing divisor | Zero |
| Confirmatory runs on a period already marked spent in `HOLDOUT.md` | Zero |
| Live trading enabled without a passed phase 3 cell | Never |

Engineering correctness and trading edge are separate gates. Phase 1 can be complete and the agent still have no strategy
worth running; on current evidence it does not yet.
